## Ahmad Shami

.NET Developer with 3+ years of experience building production systems for startups and direct clients.

My work focuses on backend and full-stack development using the modern .NET ecosystem, including ASP.NET Core, Web APIs, desktop, mobile, and web applications. I have hands-on experience designing data-driven systems, offline-first mobile applications, real-time communication, and secure backend services.

- Real-time communication concepts
- General .NET development practices
